			<h1>Lab 3: File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The idea of this lab was to further create a local file structure on my computer to have better organized files. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didn't run into any issues for this lab as it was very straight forward.
						I did kinda had a 5 minute hold up as when I opened to my browser, the webpage showed the image as way too big even though I checked the css code.
						I later realized it was cause my Google Chrome was zoomed in like 150% so everything was good after I reset zoom back to 100%, haha.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab definitely helped a lot as it had us add lists for each lab on our homepage which makes checking each lab easy as a click.
						I would like to say, even though the lab was short and simple, I made sure to put in full effort as this was honestly very interesting to do.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>The following images are the index.html homepage screenshot and the local file structure screenshot. My file structure on windows has everything organized into folders.</p>
					<img id="screenshothtml" src="img/screenshothtml.jpg"/> <img id="screenshotfilestructure" src="img/screenshotfilestructure.jpg"/>
